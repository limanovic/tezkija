Daily Qur’an

## Short description (80 chars max)

Daily Qur’an passages by notification — in order or at random. 100% offline.

## Full description (4000 chars max)

Receive a passage of the Qur’an every day, at the times you choose — as a simple notification on your device. Tap it, and the Reader opens exactly that passage.

**How it works**

Pick one or more daily times. Each one is its own wird: choose whether it arrives as a few ayahs or as full mushaf pages, and how many.

Each time can be set to either:

• **In order** — it takes the next passage of the mushaf, starting at Al-Fatiha and going on from wherever the reading last stopped. Finish An-Nas and it begins again at the start.
• **Random** — a different passage every time, chosen at random.

Times set to In order share one reading. Set three of them and the morning brings 1:1, midday 1:2, evening 1:3 — one continuous passage through the mushaf, split across the day rather than three separate readings all starting over. Any time you set to Random sits outside that progression and never moves it, so an ordered wird in the morning and a random ayah in the evening work exactly as you would expect.

**Features**

• Daily passages by local notification, at your chosen times
• In order or random, set per delivery time — the in-order times share one continuous reading
• Ayahs or mushaf pages, in the amount you choose
• Uthmani Arabic text in the script of the Madani mushaf
• 12 translations: English (Sahih International), Bosnian (Muhamed Mehanović), Albanian (Hasan Efendi Nahi), German (Bubenheim & Elyas), Turkish (Diyanet İşleri), French (Muhammad Hamidullah), Spanish (Julio Cortés), Italian (Hamza Roberto Piccardo), Dutch (Fred Leemhuis), Russian (Эльмир Кулиев), Indonesian (Kementerian Agama RI), Urdu (Fateh Muhammad Jalandhry)
• Show several translations side by side with the Arabic, or on their own

## Graphics checklist

Generated into `store/graphics/` — see the README there. Regenerate with
`store/graphics/render.sh`.

- [x] App icon 512×512 PNG, no alpha — `graphics/play-icon-512.png`
- [x] Feature graphic 1024×500 — `graphics/feature-graphic-1024x500.png`
- [x] In-app icon matches the Play icon — the Rub el Hizb mark shipped in
      `assets/images/` (commit "icons")
- [x] Phone screenshots, 1440×2970 — five in `graphics/screenshots/`: home, the
      wird editor showing the sequential option, the reader, the surah list, and
      the reader in dark. Captured on a Pixel 7 Pro API 34 emulator, status bar
      cropped off the top.
- [ ] Optional: 7" and 10" tablet screenshots

Note: `capture-screenshots.sh` is stale — its taps are hard-coded coordinates
and it still reaches for Appearance on the home screen, which moved to Settings.
The current shots were driven by looking up each control's bounds with
`uiautomator dump`. Rewrite the script that way before relying on it again, and
mind that the reported bounds sit ~73px above where the app actually paints.

## Permissions to explain, if asked

`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` — used only to make a reminder arrive at the minute the
user set. Not the policy-restricted `USE_EXACT_ALARM`; the app works without the
grant, the reminder simply arrives batched a few minutes late.
